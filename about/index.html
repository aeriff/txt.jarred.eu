  <p>Nobody asked for an explanation of <a href="/">this</a>.</p>

<p>This being this particular pocket of the hypertext-transfer protocol network. This worthless few grams of brackets both square and otherwise, banished to the outer suburbs of GeoCities once they need this prime internet real estate for another extension of the Information Super Highway.</p>

Or ideas that are obvious, too obvious, the post-publish thought of which keeps them mostly private, away from re-read, re-analysed scrutiny.</p>
